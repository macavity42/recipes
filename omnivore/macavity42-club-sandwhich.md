# Club Sandwhich

## Ingredients
  12 slices white bread
  3/4 cup mayonnaise
  8 romaine lettuce leaves
  16 slices vine-ripened tomatoes
  Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper
  16 slices crispy cooked bacon
  16 ounces sliced roasted turkey
  16 frill picks, or plastic cocktail swords

## Directions

Toast the bread in a toaster, or under a broiler on both sides. Cut the lettuce 
leaves in half crosswise and form into 8 neat stacks.

To make a double-decker club: On a clean work surface, arrange 3 bread slices 
in a row. Spread 1 tablespoon mayonnaise over 1 side of each bread slice. 
Place a lettuce stack on top of the first bread slice, top with 2 tomato 
slices, and season with salt and pepper, to taste. Place 2 slices bacon over 
the tomatoes (broken to fit neatly if necessary) and top with 1/8 of the 
turkey (without letting any hang over the sides). Season the turkey with 
salt and pepper, to taste. Repeat with the second bread slice. Carefully 
place the second layered bread slice on top of the first layered bread, 
turkey side-up. Cover with the third bread slice, mayonnaise side-down.

Pin the sandwich's layers together by piercing them with 4 frill picks or 
cocktail swords through the top bread slice, in 4 places in a diamond-like 
pattern, all the way to the bottom bread slice. Repeat entire process with 
the remaining ingredients to form 3 more sandwiches.

Using a serrated knife cut each sandwich, diagonally, into 4 triangular 
pieces (each piece should be secured in the center with a pick or sword). 
Serve with potato chips and pickles.
